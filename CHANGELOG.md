## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-01

This is a major release. Headline themes:

- **Statistical variant validation (CER framework).** Every non-anchor cluster is annotated with a `cer_factor` measuring how implausible it is as basecaller-noise replicates of a larger peer under a per-position context-aware error model. Filtering happens in `speconsense-summarize`.
- **Cluster homogeneity (`err_factor`).** A peer-independent metric for whether a cluster's reads are internally consistent with the assumed sequencing-noise profile. Routes outlier clusters to a separate `.lq` track.
- **Post-phasing refinement pipeline.** Three new phases (read reassignment, discard recovery, second phasing pass) move reads between clusters and re-admit previously-discarded reads when consensus concordance supports it.
- **Identity groups (`gid`/`vid`) emitted by core, honored by summarize.** Complete-linkage groups are computed once, in core, and travel through the FASTA header into summarize, which no longer re-clusters.
- **Context-aware error models.** Per-basecaller q_ctx tables (HP run length × event type) ship as YAML and are user-overridable.
- **Pipeline phases renumbered 1–12** (replaces the nested `4a/4b/4b2/4b3/4c` scheme).

### Added

#### CER framework (statistical variant significance)

- **Critical Error Rate (CER) variant validation** (core) — Every non-anchor cluster is annotated with a `cer_factor`: the minimum across larger peers of the per-position multiplicative inflation needed for that peer's observed minor-allele counts to be plausible under the basecaller's noise model. Anchors and clusters that fail to find a comparison peer carry `cer_factor=None` and always pass. Implementation lives in `speconsense.significance` (binomial survival with combinatorial Bonferroni correction over candidate sites; uniform error model with `q=p/3`) and `speconsense.context` (per-position context classification).
- **`--significance-level / --min-cer-factor` user controls** — Core: `--significance-level` (default `1e-5`) sets the alpha used in p* solving. Summarize: `--min-cer-factor` (default `1.0`, `0` to disable) routes records below the threshold to `__Summary__/variants/{name}.ns-RiC{ric}.fasta` (and matching FASTQ) instead of dropping them
- **Multi-position significance (K>1)** — When two clusters disagree at K>1 candidate sites, the binomial test uses joint counts and a combinatorial Bonferroni correction over `C(L, K)` site pairs/triples. The site count `L` is now the **HP-compressed length** (each HP run counts once), not the raw sequence length, since multi-base HP errors are dominated by single-event mechanisms
- **Context-aware error model (q_ctx)** — `speconsense/error_models/*.yaml` ships per-basecaller error rate tables keyed by `(non-hp-sub, non-hp-indel, hp-l1 ... hp-lN)`. Each variant event is classified by HP run length (from the **reference** consensus, since the artifact hypothesis is that the candidate's reads are miscalled copies of the reference) and looked up in the table. HP runs longer than the table's max route to blanket HP normalization rather than CER evaluation.
- **`--error-model` flag** (core) — Replaces the earlier `--qctx-profile`. Resolution order: filesystem path → `~/.config/speconsense/error_models/` → bundled. `--list-error-models` lists available models. Default `dorado-v5.0`. Bundled models: `dorado-v5.0`, `dorado-v3.5`. Dorado v5.0 q_ctx values were re-estimated from the ont98 dataset under the current pipeline
- **Per-cluster CER reproduction data in metadata JSON** — `clusters/{specimen}_metadata.json` now includes per-cluster `cer_details` (peer id, K, p*, joint q, per-position context tags and q_ctx values, reference idx) so CER decisions can be replayed offline
- **`cer_factor=` and `cer_details=` FASTA fields** — Replaces the old `cer=` / `cer.a=` fields. The header carries only the scalar factor; full per-position detail lives in metadata JSON

#### Cluster homogeneity (err_factor)

- **`err_factor` cluster homogeneity metric** (core) — For each non-gap consensus column, the fraction of reads disagreeing with the consensus divided by the q_ctx rate predicted for that column's context (HP run length or non-HP). Values near 1.0 mean reads consistent with basecaller noise; values ≫ 1.0 indicate internal heterogeneity beyond what sequencing noise produces. Computed in `msa.compute_cluster_err_factor`; emitted as `err_factor=` in the FASTA header and stored with raw `obs_sum`/`exp_sum`/`cols` in metadata JSON. Unlike `cer_factor`, `err_factor` is peer-independent — it distinguishes novel-but-real sequences (low) from noise combinations (high)
- **`--max-err-factor`** (summarize) — Default `1.5`; `0` disables. Records above threshold route to `__Summary__/variants/{name}.lq-RiC{ric}.fasta`. `.lq` takes precedence over `.ns` when both fire. The 1.5 default is safe because MAD outlier removal at final consensus removes single-read outliers that would otherwise inflate err_factor on real clusters

#### Post-phasing refinement (new pipeline phases)

- **Cross-cluster read reassignment within identity groups** (core, phase 6) — After variant phasing, reads can move between clusters in the same complete-linkage identity group when the new cluster's consensus better explains them. Concordance scoring uses position-aware variant agreement; an edit-distance guard prevents drift across distinct sequences. New flags `--disable-read-reassignment` / `--enable-read-reassignment` (default enabled)
- **Discard recovery** (core, phase 7) — Reads previously dropped (failed phasing, MAD outliers, hard-floor or noise-filter dropouts) are re-tested against surviving cluster consensuses; concordant reads re-enter their best-fitting cluster. New flags `--disable-discard-recovery` / `--enable-discard-recovery` (default enabled). Auto-skipped if `--disable-read-reassignment` is set, since recovery uses the same concordance machinery. Reassigned discards no longer get a `d-` prefix on read IDs
- **Second phasing pass** (core, phase 8) — Re-phases any clusters whose membership changed via reassignment/recovery. Gated by `--enable-position-phasing` AND `--enable-read-reassignment` — if reassignment is off, nothing changed since the first pass and there's no useful work to do
- **Noise filter** (core, phase 5) — `_filter_noisy_clusters` runs SPOA on each small cluster and disbands those with no-majority columns (positions where no base reaches 50%). Reads from disbanded clusters fall to the discard pool; some may return via phase 7
- **No-majority ambiguity calling** — When phasing produces a single qualifying haplotype, IUPAC codes are generated for every variant position. The lower count threshold (`--min-ambiguity-count`, default 3) captures variation that doesn't have enough support to form its own cluster

#### Identity groups (gid/vid) end-to-end

- **Complete-linkage identity grouping** (core) — Replaces the previous chained/single-linkage scheme. Every pair within a group must meet `--group-identity` (default `0.85`), preventing transitive collapse of close-but-distinct variants in eDNA-style mixtures. Implementation uses `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster`. Identity groups gate read reassignment, discard recovery, and CER validation
- **`gid=` and `vid=` FASTA fields** (core) — Each cluster receives an identity-group rank (`gid`) and within-group variant rank (`vid`). Output filenames switch from `-c{cluster_num}` to `-{gid}.v{vid}` end-to-end (core's `-all.fasta`, summarize's outputs, debug fastqs)
- **Summarize honors core grouping** — `speconsense-summarize` parses `gid`/`vid` from the FASTA header and skips its previous independent HAC re-clustering. Only **cross-primer overlap merging** still runs across core groups, for the primer-pool use case (ITS/ITS1/ITS2). Hard-fails on inputs lacking `gid=`/`vid=` (i.e., refuses to process pre-0.8 outputs without re-running core)
- **Cross-primer overlap merger** (summarize) — Configured by `--group-identity` (default `0.85`, matches core's anchor identity) and `--min-merge-overlap`. Merges different-primer core groups whose anchors overlap above the identity threshold

#### Other additions

- **MAD-based outlier removal at final consensus** (core) — Replaces the earlier `--outlier-identity` static threshold. Computes per-read identity to consensus, drops reads beyond `n × MAD` from the median (robust to skewed distributions). No knob — runs unconditionally. Removes single-read outliers that would otherwise inflate `err_factor`
- **Per-specimen variant tree** (summarize) — `__Summary__/trees/{specimen}.txt` renders an ASCII hierarchy of every variant in a specimen (passed, `.ns`, `.lq` together), grouped by core identity group. Each non-anchor variant branches from the larger-size peer with the highest pairwise identity, with a one-line edit summary (substitutions, single-nt indels, short ≤3 nt indels, long indels). Filtered variants carry the on-disk status marker (`-1.v4.ns`, `-1.v8.lq`) so they're visually distinct from passed variants that may share the same vid after summarize's renaming
- **`--hp-normalization-length` parameter** (core + summarize) — Unifies the HP threshold across `are_homopolymer_equivalent`, `_classify_subcluster_groups`, `is_homopolymer_event`, distance calculations, and MSA-based variant merging. Default 6 matches the HP error rate paper's recommendation of CER-evaluating L≤5 HP variants. Set to 1 for legacy blanket-normalize-all behavior
- **`build_adjustment_params(hp_normalization_length=N)` factory** (`speconsense.distances`) — Returns an `AdjustmentParams` variant with the requested HP threshold, sharing all other STANDARD settings
- **`--disable-read-reassignment` / `--enable-read-reassignment`** (core) — Gates phase 6
- **`--disable-discard-recovery` / `--enable-discard-recovery`** (core) — Gates phase 7
- **HP error rate analysis paper** — Two new papers under `docs/`: `cer_in_practice/` (the CER framework as shipped) and `hp_error_rate/` (per-context error rate estimation)

### Changed

- **Identity grouping moved entirely to core** (architecture) — Previously summarize ran its own HAC on consensus sequences. Now core computes one set of complete-linkage identity groups; summarize honors them via FASTA-header `gid`/`vid`. Within-group MSA-based variant merging in summarize is unchanged
- **CER filtering moved core → summarize** (architecture) — Core annotates every cluster with `cer_factor` and writes everything to disk. The pass/ns decision is applied by summarize via `--min-cer-factor`. This lets users adjust the threshold without re-running core
- **Bonferroni site count uses HP-compressed length** (core) — Multi-position CER significance was previously divided by the raw sequence length. Now uses HP-compressed length (each run counts once) since multi-base HP errors are correlated, not independent. Slightly reduces conservatism for K>1 variants in HP-rich amplicons
- **`--hp-min-length` renamed to `--hp-normalization-length`** (core) — Same semantics, same default (6); previous name was opaque about what the threshold controls. Profile key `hp-min-length` likewise renamed
- **`--qctx-profile` renamed to `--error-model`** (core) — Same resolution order, same YAML format; previous name overloaded "profile" with the parameter-profile system. The `error_models/` package directory replaces the earlier name
- **Default `--max-err-factor=1.5`** (summarize) — Was unset in 0.7.x. The 1.5 default is safe in conjunction with MAD outlier removal at final consensus
- **Internal cluster-merging and identity-grouping HP threshold honored** (core) — `are_homopolymer_equivalent` and `_classify_subcluster_groups` were silently using a hardcoded 6 instead of `self.min_hp_length`; now respect the user-configured value
- **Per-specimen INFO log rationalized** (core) — Each pipeline stage now emits one uniform `[N clusters, R/T reads, P%]  {stage}: {outcome}` line, with a fixed running-state column on the left. Stage labels reworded for user-facing clarity (`Pre/Post-phasing merge` → `Cluster equivalence merge [(round 2)]`, `After phasing` → `Variant phasing`, `Second phasing pass` → `Variant phasing (round 2)`, `CER annotation` → `Significance testing`). Configuration and procedural messages (e.g. `Position-based variant phasing enabled`, `Running MCL algorithm`) demoted to DEBUG. No-op stages (no merges, no reads moved, no splits, no recovered reads) demoted to DEBUG. Per-cluster MAD outlier drops aggregated into a single `Outlier filter` summary line. The `Final` line is now emitted *after* outlier removal, so its totals reflect what was actually written to disk
- **Quality report rewritten** (summarize) — Replaced the descriptive multi-table dump with an inspection-oriented report. New sections: executive summary (with a count of specimens that had input reads but produced no clusters), passed variants worth inspecting (run-relative outliers on `err_factor` and ambiguity, mean ± 2σ), possible rescues (low-yield specimens whose filtered variants are close to the threshold), overlap merge details (only when present), run-wide parameter signals (suggesting tuning), pipeline activity. The CER and err_factor filter decisions now appear in the report; the "Read Identity" and "Positional Identity" outlier tables are dropped (subsumed by the err_factor outlier ranking)
- **Quality report yield computed from cluster size, not RiC** (summarize) — RiC reflects sampling cap, not biological yield; cluster size is the right denominator for per-specimen yield estimation
- **Variants qualified for phasing on full cluster OR quality-biased sample** (core) — Either a position passes the variant frequency threshold across the full cluster, or it passes within a quality-biased sample (top-quality reads). Catches signal that was being diluted out by low-quality reads under the old all-or-nothing test
- **Bundled profiles aligned with new pipeline** — `herbarium`: disable CER and err_factor filters in summarize (high recall; degraded DNA inflates err_factor and weak-signal variants warrant review). `largedata`: tighten core `group-identity` to 0.95 (matches summarize; smaller identity groups reduce work in phases 6/7/9 on bloated groups). `nostalgia`: disable read reassignment, discard recovery, CER and err_factor filters (older pipelines lacked all four). `strict`: migrate `min-cluster-ratio` (global) to `select-min-size-ratio` (per-group; preserves precision intent without suppressing secondary primer pairs in multi-target work)

### Fixed

- **CER solver numerical bounds for high-K variants** — The joint-q solver could overflow or underflow at very small p*. Tightened bisection bounds and clamped intermediate values
- **Specimens with all variants filtered now emit `.ns`/`.lq` files** (summarize) — The per-specimen processing loop previously iterated only over file paths in the passing list. Specimens whose every variant was routed to `.ns` or `.lq` were skipped entirely and their filter outputs were lost. The loop now iterates the union of file paths across passing/`.ns`/`.lq` lists
- **Merged variants now retain `gid`/`vid`** (summarize) — `merge_variants_with_msa` was constructing the merged `ConsensusInfo` without copying `group_rank` / `variant_rank` from the largest input variant, leaving them unset on every post-merge record. Now propagated

### Removed

- **`--enable-full-consensus` removed** (summarize) — The all-indel IUPAC consensus output (`.full`) was dominated on every metric tested in the blast_query analysis: no measurable benefit under adjusted identity, severe regression under raw BLAST (~58 pp at ≥99%) because no real haplotype contains all the unioned indels at once. The companion SNP-merging path (`--merge-indel-length`, `--merge-position-count`) is the recommended query output and is unchanged. The `compressed` profile no longer sets `enable-full-consensus: true`. User profiles still setting `enable-full-consensus:` will fail validation. Existing `.full` records in pre-existing `__Summary__/` directories are no longer recognized by `--aggregate-only`; regenerate by re-running summarize
- **`--enable-early-filter` / `--disable-early-filter` removed** (core) — The early filter applied `--min-size` and `--min-cluster-ratio` after pre-phasing merge to skip variant phasing on doomed-small clusters. In practice the flag was disabled by default, no bundled profile enabled it, and the unconditional hard-floor filter (drop clusters < 3 reads) covers the most useful case. Filtering by `--min-size` / `--min-cluster-ratio` continues at the post-phasing size-filtering phase. User profiles still setting `enable-early-filter:` will fail validation
- **`--outlier-identity` removed** (core) — Static identity threshold for outlier removal replaced by MAD-based detection at final consensus. No knob — runs unconditionally
- **HAC clustering code path in summarize removed** — Summarize no longer re-groups consensus sequences; identity groups come from core via `gid`/`vid`. Cross-primer overlap merger is the only remaining cross-group operation
- **`cer=` / `cer.a=` FASTA fields removed** — Replaced by `cer_factor=` (header) and `cer_details=` (metadata JSON)

### Pipeline numbering

- **Phases renumbered sequentially 1–12** (core) — The previous nested numbering (`4a`/`4b`/`4b2`/`4b3`/`4c`) was historical accretion that obscured the linear flow. Phases now run in plain sequence: (1) initial clustering → (2) pre-phasing merge → (3) variant phasing → (4) post-phasing merge → (5) noise filter → (6) read reassignment → (7) discard recovery → (8) second phasing pass → (9) CER validation → (10) size filtering → (11) output generation → (12) discarded-reads writeout. User-facing log labels were already name-based and are unchanged. CLI flags, profile keys, and metadata field names are unchanged

### Performance

- **Noise-filter SPOA parallelized** (core) — `_filter_noisy_clusters` now dispatches per-cluster SPOA via `ProcessPoolExecutor` when `--threads N>1` and more than 10 small clusters are queued, mirroring the existing parallelization pattern in `merge_similar_clusters`. Sequential fallback preserved for `--threads 1`. At 100K-read inputs this phase used to hang for tens of minutes on serial SPOA; with `--threads 8` it now completes in low single-digit minutes
- **Identity grouping sparsified for large cluster counts** (core) — `_form_identity_groups` (called by read reassignment, discard recovery, and CER validation) now uses `ScalablePairwiseOperation.compute_distance_matrix` when the cluster count exceeds 50 AND the scalability threshold (default 1001 reads). vsearch finds candidate pairs at the relaxed identity threshold (`group_identity × 0.9 = 0.765`); each candidate is rescored under the same HP-normalized metric as the dense path; missing pairs default to distance 1.0, which under complete linkage forces the corresponding clusters into separate groups. Reduces ~7.8M edlib calls per invocation (at 2792 clusters) to a few thousand candidate refinements. Falls back to the dense O(n²) loop when scalability is disabled, vsearch is missing, or the cluster count is small. `_get_scalable_operation` now accepts an optional `scoring_function` kwarg so call sites can override the default similarity metric
- **Discard screening sparsified for large discard pools** (core) — `_run_discard_reassignment`'s screening pass replaces the per-discard scan over all cluster consensuses with a batched vsearch query (top-K=10) refined by edlib on the candidate slice — same metric as the dense path. Activates when the discard pool exceeds the scalability threshold. At 100K reads with 15K discards this collapses ~42M edlib calls to a single vsearch index build plus ~150K candidate refinements. Falls back to the dense per-discard loop when scalability is disabled
- **CER validation within-group top-K for large identity groups** (core) — `_validate_identity_group` now compares each candidate against its top-K=10 most similar larger peers rather than all larger peers, when the group exceeds 50 clusters. The reported `cer_factor` is the minimum across compared pairs, dominated by the most-similar peer (smaller pairwise distance → smaller K → tighter Bonferroni → smaller factor); top-K preserves this minimum with very high probability. Min over a subset is always ≥ min over the full set, so the approximation can only over-report factors, never under-report — i.e., approximation errors result in slightly less filtering, never over-filtering. vsearch returns top-30 most similar peers per query (3× headroom for the case where many of a candidate's most-similar peers are smaller-than-self); the loop intersects with the strict-larger-peer reference pool and takes the first 10. Falls back to the dense O(K²) pairwise comparison when group size ≤ 50 or scalability is disabled

### Dependencies

- `adjusted-identity` requirement bumped to `>=0.2.7` for the `hp_normalize_min_length` `AdjustmentParams` field

### Migration notes (0.7.x → 0.8.0)

- **Re-run core before re-running summarize.** Summarize hard-fails on FASTA inputs lacking `gid=`/`vid=` headers. Pre-0.8 `clusters/` directories cannot be summarized in place — re-run `speconsense` to regenerate
- **Drop `enable-full-consensus`, `enable-early-filter`, `--outlier-identity` from user profiles.** All three keys/flags now fail validation
- **Rename `--qctx-profile` → `--error-model` and `--hp-min-length` → `--hp-normalization-length`** in any wrapper scripts. Profile keys likewise renamed (`qctx-profile` → `error-model`, `hp-min-length` → `hp-normalization-length`)
- **Filename schema changed from `-c{N}` to `-{gid}.v{vid}` everywhere.** Tools that parse speconsense filenames need updating. The original-namespace `-c{N}` debug filenames are no longer emitted by core
- **`cer=`/`cer.a=` FASTA fields are gone.** Tools reading FASTA headers should switch to `cer_factor=` (and `err_factor=` for the new homogeneity metric)

## [0.7.7] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **`--specimen` flag** (summarize) — Process only a single specimen, outputting per-specimen files and a JSON summary to stdout. Designed for incremental invocation by specimux-suite orchestration layer
- **`--aggregate-only` flag** (summarize) — Regenerate aggregate `summary.fasta` from existing per-specimen outputs without reprocessing. Parses metadata (`raw_ric`, `raw_len`, `snp_count`) back from FASTA headers for full-fidelity reconstruction

### Fixed
- **Stale output file cleanup** — Single-specimen mode removes previous output files before reprocessing to prevent accumulation when variant counts change between runs
- **Temp log file leak** — Early-return paths (e.g., no sequences found) now clean up the temporary log file
- **Glob escaping in specimen cleanup** — Specimen IDs containing glob metacharacters no longer match unintended files

## [0.7.6] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- **`.full` consensus suppressed for single-variant groups** — When `--enable-full-consensus` is active but a group has only one surviving post-merge variant, the `.full` output is now omitted (it would be redundant). `.full` is still generated when multiple post-merge variants survive in the group, even if `--select-max-variants` limits the number actually output

### Fixed
- **Truncated sequences no longer distort HAC grouping** — A short consensus (e.g., 220bp vs 660bp) could cause `calculate_adjusted_identity_distance` to return near-zero distance due to terminal gap exclusion scoring only the overlap region. This caused complete-linkage HAC to split full-length sequences (>99% identical) into separate groups. Added coverage and adjustment-ratio guards that fall back to raw edlib identity when adjusted identity is unreliable

## [0.7.5] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Full consensus now includes only surviving variants' components** — `.full` consensus previously applied `merge-min-size-ratio` independently against pre-merge sizes, which used a different (looser) reference than the post-merge `select-min-size-ratio` filter. This caused `.full` RiC to exceed the sum of variant RiCs when merging inflated the denominator. Now `.full` is built from exactly the pre-merge variants that contributed to post-merge variants surviving `select-min-size-ratio`

## [0.7.4] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **`--select-min-size-ratio` parameter** (summarize) — Filters out post-merge variants whose size ratio to the largest variant in their group falls below the threshold (default: 0 = disabled, e.g. 0.2 for 20% cutoff). Applied after merging, before variant selection

### Changed
- **`compressed` bundled profile** — Now includes `select-min-size-ratio: 0.2` to match 20% calling threshold theme

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- **`--enable-full-consensus` flag** (summarize) — Generates a full IUPAC consensus per variant group from all pre-merge variants (gaps never win). Output named `{specimen}-{group}.full`
- **`compressed` bundled profile** — Aggressive variant merging with indel support, 20% frequency thresholds, and full consensus enabled
- **Complement flags for all boolean CLI options** — Allows CLI override of profile-set boolean values (e.g., `--enable-merging` overrides `--disable-merging` set by a profile)

### Changed
- Extracted shared metadata assembly into `_build_merged_consensus_info()` helper in `merging.py` (reduces duplication across three consensus-from-MSA functions)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **Scalability mode** - Automatic vsearch-based acceleration for large datasets (1000+ sequences), reducing O(n²) pairwise comparisons to ~O(n log n)
  - `--scale-threshold N` sets activation threshold (default: 1001, 0 to disable)
  - `--threads N` controls internal parallelism (speconsense default: 1, summarize default: auto)
  - Requires vsearch (`conda install bioconda::vsearch`), falls back to brute-force if missing
- **Profile system** - YAML-based parameter presets for reproducible workflows
  - Use with `-p herbarium`, `-p strict`, `-p nostalgia`, or `-p largedata`
  - User profiles in `~/.config/speconsense/profiles/`
  - Bundled profiles: `herbarium` (high-recall), `strict` (high-precision), `nostalgia` (simulate older pipelines), `largedata` (large input files)
- **Merge control options** (summarize):
  - `--disable-merging` skips MSA-based merge evaluation entirely (fastest when merging not needed)
  - `--merge-effort` controls merge thoroughness: `fast`, `balanced` (default), `thorough`, or numeric 6-14
- **Length filtering** (summarize) - `--min-len` and `--max-len` filter sequences before processing
- **Primer-constrained overlap merging** - Overlap-aware distance only applies when sequences have different primer pairs, preventing chimeras from incorrectly merging with shorter amplicons
- **Hybrid linkage for HAC clustering** - Uses single-linkage when overlap merging is enabled (for transitive overlap relationships), complete linkage otherwise
- **Performance options** - `--enable-early-filter` skips phasing on clusters that will be filtered; `--collect-discards` writes discarded reads for inspection
- **Cluster boundary delimiters** - Merged FASTQ files include synthetic boundary records between clusters for easier inspection
- **Profile parameters reference** - New `docs/profile-parameters.md` with complete parameter tables for all profiles

### Changed
- **Default `--min-cluster-ratio`**: 0.20 → 0.01 (keep small clusters for downstream curation)
- **Default `--min-variant-frequency`**: 0.20 → 0.10 (unified with ambiguity threshold)
- **Default `--max-sample-size`**: 500 → 100 (sufficient for consensus quality)
- **Default `--merge-min-size-ratio`** (summarize): 0.0 → 0.1 (prevent small clusters from adding IUPAC to large ones)
- **Reduced MAX_MSA_MERGE_VARIANTS** from 10 to 8 for better performance in large variant groups
- **Code architecture** - Refactored `core.py` into `core/` subpackage and `summarize.py` into `summarize/` subpackage
- **CLI organization** - Options grouped into logical categories in `--help` output

### Fixed
- **`--merge-snp` option** - Now correctly supports `--no-merge-snp` to disable SNP merging from command line
- **`--collect-discards` option** - Fixed incomplete discard tracking that missed some filtered reads
- **README documentation** - Fixed incorrect defaults and examples (variant-frequency, merge-min-size-ratio, missing tools/profiles)

## [0.6.6] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **`raw_ric` metadata loss during iterative merging** - Fixed two bugs causing `rawric` field and variant files to be missing
  - Bug 1: When iteration 2+ found no new merges, single-variant pass-through incorrectly called `create_*_from_msa()` which reset `raw_ric` to None
  - Bug 2: `raw_ric` was not flattening prior merge history (unlike `raw_len`), causing iterative merges to show summed values instead of original cluster RiCs
  - Result: `rawric` field missing from FASTA headers, `.raw` variant files not created in `__Summary__/variants/`
  - Fix: Skip `create_*_from_msa()` for single-variant subsets; flatten `raw_ric` like `raw_len` to preserve original values

## [0.6.5] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed
- **Merge traceability loss during iterative merging** - Fixed bug where FASTQ output files contained fewer reads than expected
  - When iterative merging occurred in overlap mode, the merge traceability dictionary was being overwritten rather than expanded
  - This caused loss of original cluster names when a merged result got merged again
  - Result: incomplete FASTQ file concatenation (fewer reads than RiC value indicated)
  - Fix: traceability now expands intermediate merges to preserve all original cluster names through the merge chain

## [0.6.4] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed
- **IUPAC code expansion during variant merging** - Fixed bug where merging a base with an existing IUPAC code would incorrectly produce 'N'
  - Example: C + Y previously produced N, now correctly produces Y (since Y = C|T)
  - Added `merge_bases_to_iupac()` helper that expands existing IUPAC codes before combining
  - Affects all three merge code paths in summarize.py

## [0.6.3] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **Separate IUPAC ambiguity calling thresholds** - Independent parameters for ambiguity calling vs variant phasing
  - New `--min-ambiguity-frequency` parameter (default: 0.10 = 10%, lower than phasing threshold)
  - New `--min-ambiguity-count` parameter (default: 3, lower than phasing threshold)
  - Allows conservative phasing while capturing more residual variation as IUPAC codes
  - Parameters recorded in run metadata JSON

### Fixed
- **Empty input file handling** - Fixed crash (ZeroDivisionError) when input file contains no sequences
  - Now exits gracefully with warning message and exit code 0
  - Added defensive check in size filtering to prevent division by zero

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **Overlap merge feature for primer pools** - Merge sequences of different lengths when they share sufficient overlap
  - New `--min-merge-overlap` parameter (default: 200bp, 0 to disable)
  - Enables primer pool workflows where reads have overlapping but different coverage

  - Moved `parse_score_aligned_for_errors`, `extract_alignments_from_msa`, `analyze_positional_variation` functions
  - Moved variant phasing functions: `is_variant_position_with_composition`, `call_iupac_ambiguities`, `calculate_within_cluster_error`, `group_reads_by_allele_combo`, `filter_qualifying_haplotypes`, `reassign_to_nearest_haplotype`, `select_correlated_positions`
  - Improves code organization and testability
- **Refactored cluster() method** - Split 318-line monolithic method into 6 focused phase methods
  - `_run_initial_clustering()` - Phase 1: MCL or greedy clustering
  - `_run_prephasing_merge()` - Phase 2: Merge clusters before variant detection
  - `_run_variant_phasing()` - Phase 3: Detect variants and phase reads

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-06

### Added
- **Homopolymer-aware variant merging** - MSA-based merging now distinguishes structural indels from homopolymer length differences
  - Analyzes SPOA alignment to classify each indel event (consecutive run) as structural or homopolymer
  - Homopolymer indels (e.g., AAA vs AAAA) are ignored when checking merge compatibility by default
  - Structural indels (true insertions/deletions) count against merge limits
  - Matches adjusted-identity semantics used throughout the pipeline
  - Enables more aggressive merging of biologically equivalent sequences while preserving structural variation
- **`--disable-homopolymer-equivalence` option** - Allows strict identity merging when homopolymer length variation should be preserved
  - Treats all indels (both homopolymer and structural) as blocking merges
  - Useful for applications where homopolymer length variation is biologically significant

### Fixed
- **Indel event counting** - Corrected `--merge-position-count` to count indel events instead of indel columns
  - Previously: A 3bp deletion counted as 3 positions, incorrectly limiting merging
  - Now: Each consecutive indel run counts as 1 event, matching documented behavior
  - Example: `--merge-position-count 3` now correctly allows up to 3 indel events (of any length ≤ `--merge-indel-length`)
  - Event-based approach groups consecutive indel columns, then classifies each complete event as homopolymer or structural
- **SNP detection** - Fixed to exclude alignment columns containing gaps
  - Previously: Columns with gaps and multiple bases (e.g., `['-', 'G', 'A']`) were incorrectly counted as both SNPs and indels
  - Now: SNPs are only columns with multiple different bases and NO gaps
  - Columns with gaps are exclusively classified as indels

### Changed
- **Enhanced merge logging** - Merge messages now distinguish between structural indels and homopolymer indels
  - Example: "Found mergeable subset of 2 variants: 2 SNPs, 1 homopolymer indels"
  - Provides clearer insight into why sequences are being merged
- **Improved edge case handling** - Homopolymer detection now requires strict flanking base agreement
  - Adjacent indel columns cannot validate each other as homopolymer context
  - All sequences must agree on the flanking base (not just any sequence)
  - Correctly distinguishes SNP+indel combinations from true homopolymer indels

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive README updates** - Added detailed documentation of homopolymer-aware merging
  - How homopolymer vs structural indel classification works

  - Applies to all output files (FASTA, FASTQ) and raw files (`.v1.raw1`, `.v1.raw2`)
- **`--select-max-variants` parameter semantics** - Now includes primary variant in total count
