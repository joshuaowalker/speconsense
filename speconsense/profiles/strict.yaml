# High-precision settings for confident results
#
# Use this profile when:
# - Precision is more important than recall
# - You need high-confidence sequences for publication
# - Working with well-characterized reference databases
# - False positives would be more problematic than false negatives
#
# The settings prioritize quality over completeness, filtering out
# low-support variants and limiting output to well-supported sequences.
