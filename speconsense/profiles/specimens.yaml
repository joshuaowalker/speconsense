# Balanced settings for fresh specimen tissue
#
# Use this profile when working with:
# - Fresh tissue samples with good DNA quality
# - Specimens that can be resampled if needed
# - Standard fungal barcoding workflows
#
# These settings match the default parameters in speconsense 0.7.x.
# This profile is useful for explicitly documenting your workflow
# or when switching between different profiles.
